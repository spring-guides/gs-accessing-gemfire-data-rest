This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that accesses data stored in
https://geode.apache.org/[{apache-geode-name}] through a link:/guides/gs/rest-hateoas[hypermedia-based]
link:/understanding/REST[REST-ful frontend].

== What you'll build

You'll build a _Spring_ Web application that let's you create and retrieve `Person` objects stored in the
https://geode.apache.org/[{apache-geode-name}] In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) using Spring Data REST.
Spring Data REST takes the features of https://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas[Spring HATEOAS]
and https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode[Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}] and combines them together
automatically.

NOTE: Spring Data REST also supports link:/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest[Spring Data JPA],
link:/guides/gs/accessing-mongodb-data-rest[Spring Data MongoDB]
and link:/guides/gs/accessing-neo4j-data-rest[Spring Data Neo4j] as backend data stores,
but those are not part of this guide.

TIP: For more general knowledge of {apache-geode-name} concepts and accessing data from {apache-geode-name}, read through the guide,
https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-gemfire/[Accessing Data with {apache-geode-name}].

[[scratch]]
== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr]. Spring Initializr
offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for an application and does a lot of the set up for you.
This example needs "_Spring for Apache Geode_" dependency.

[[initial]]
== Create a domain object

Create a new domain object to present a person.

`src/main/java/hello/Person.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Person.java[]
----

The `Person` has a first and last name. {apache-geode-name} domain objects need an id, so an `AtomicLong` is being used
to increment with each `Person` object creation.

[[repository]]
== Create a Person Repository

Next, you need to create a simple _Repository_ to persist/access `Person` objects stored in {apache-geode-name}.

`src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java[]
----

This _Repository_ is an interface and will allow you to perform various data access operations (e.g. basic CRUD
and simple queries) involving `Person` objects. It gets these operations by extending `CrudRepository`.

At runtime, _Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}_ will create an implementation of this interface automatically.
Then, Spring Data REST will use the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/{spring_data_rest}/api/org/springframework/data/rest/core/annotation/RepositoryRestResource.html[@RepositoryRestResource]
annotation to direct Spring MVC to create REST-ful endpoints at `/people`.

NOTE: `@RepositoryRestResource` is not required for a _Repository_ to be exported. It is only used to change the export
details, such as using `/people` instead of the default value of `/persons`.

Here you have also defined a custom query to retrieve a list of `Person` objects based on `lastName`. You'll see how to
invoke it further down in this guide.

[[executable]]
== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to
an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package
everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use _Spring's_
support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying
to an external servlet container.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

The `@EnableGemfireRepositories` annotation activates _Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}_ _Repositories_.
_Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}_ will create a concrete implementation of the `PersonRepository` interface
and configure it to talk to an embedded instance of {apache-geode-name}.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

[[testing]]
== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it. You can use any REST client you wish. The following examples uses
the *nix tool `curl`.

First you want to see the top level service.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
{
  "_links" : {
    "people" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people"
    }
  }
}
```

Here you get your first glimpse of what this server has to offer. There is a **people** link located at
http://localhost:8080/people. _Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}_ doesn't support pagination like the other
Spring Data REST guides so there are no extra navigational links.

NOTE: Spring Data REST uses the https://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL format] for JSON output. It is flexible
and offers a convenient way to supply links adjacent to the data that is served.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search"
    }
  }
}
```

Time to create a new `Person`!

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{  "firstName" : "Frodo",  "lastName" : "Baggins" }' http://localhost:8080/people
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Location: http://localhost:8080/people/1
Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2014 20:16:11 GMT
```

- `-i` ensures you can see the response message including the headers. The URI of the newly created `Person` is shown
- `-X POST` issues a `POST` HTTP request to create a new entry
- `-H "Content-Type:application/json"` sets the content-type so the application knows the payload contains a JSON object
- `-d '{  "firstName" : "Frodo",  "lastName" : "Baggins" }'` is the data being sent

NOTE: Notice how the previous `POST` operation includes a `Location` header. This contains the URI of
the newly created resource. Spring Data REST also has two methods on `RepositoryRestConfiguration.setReturnBodyOnCreate(…)`
and `setReturnBodyOnCreate(…)` which you can use to configure the framework to immediately return the representation
of the resource just created.

From this you can query for all people:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search"
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "persons" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  }
}
```

The **people** collection resource contains a list with Frodo. Notice how it includes a **self** link. Spring Data REST
also uses https://www.atteo.org/2011/12/12/Evo-Inflector.html[Evo Inflector] to pluralize the name of the entity
for groupings.

You can query directly for the individual record:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/1
{
  "firstName" : "Frodo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/1"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: This might appear to be purely web based, but behind the scenes, it is talking to
an embedded {apache-geode-name} database.

In this guide, there is only one domain object. With a more complex system where domain objects are related
to each other, Spring Data REST will render additional links to help navigate to connected records.

Find all the custom queries:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/search
{
  "_links" : {
    "findByLastName" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search/findByLastName{?name}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  }
}
```

You can see the URL for the query including the HTTP query parameter `name`. If you'll notice, this matches
the `@Param("name")` annotation embedded in the interface.

To use the `findByLastName` query, do this:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/search/findByLastName?name=Baggins
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "persons" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  }
}
```

Because you defined it to return `List<Person>` in the code, it will return all of the results. If you had defined it
to only return `Person`, it would pick one of the `Person` objects to return. Since this can be unpredictable,
you probably don't want to do that for queries that can return multiple entries.

You can also issue `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` REST calls to either replace, update, or delete existing records.

```
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{ "firstName": "Bilbo", "lastName": "Baggins" }' http://localhost:8080/people/1
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/1
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/1"
    }
  }
}
```

```
$ curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{ "firstName": "Bilbo Jr." }' http://localhost:8080/people/1
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/1
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo Jr.",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/1"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: `PUT` replaces an entire record. Fields not supplied will be replaced with `null`. `PATCH` can be used to
update a subset of items.

You can delete records:

```
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/people/1
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search"
    }
  }
}
```

A very convenient aspect of this link:/understanding/HATEOAS[hypermedia-driven interface] is how you can discover
all the REST-ful endpoints using `curl` (or whatever REST client you are using). There is no need to exchange
a formal contract or interface document with your customers.

[[summary]]
